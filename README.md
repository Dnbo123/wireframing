# wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.
Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process include :
  1. Clraifies the design process
     .Wireframes enable stakeholders tonvisualize the layout and structure of the interface early on, enabling a shared understanding of design expectations.
  2. Facilitates Early Feedback
     .They are easy to modify, making them an excellent tool for gathering feedback and making adjustments before moving to high-fidelity designs or development.
  3. Saves Time and Resources
      .Help in dentifying potential issues early in the process, reducing the risk of costly revisions later in the project.
